        <h3 class="text-left">Don't let accessibility become a roadblock</h3>
        <p>Accessibility should never become a hindrance for website users. Imagine trying to navigate a website without
          the use of a mouse or the ability to see anything on the screen - this can be a frustrating and isolating
          experience.</p>
        <p>To ensure that everyone can access and navigate a website with ease, it's crucial to remove common barriers
          that may hinder their experience. This means making websites accessible for all, regardless of their
          abilities.</p>
